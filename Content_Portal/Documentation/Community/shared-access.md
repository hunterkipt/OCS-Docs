# Shared Access Routes

API routes related to accessing OCS shared resources.

***

## Authentication

All endpoints referenced in this documentation require authenticated access. You must set the Authorization header to the access token you retrieved from a successful authentication request.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Requests made without an access token or an invalid/expired token will fail with a 401 Unauthorized response.

Requests made with an access token which does not have the correct permissions (see security subsection on every endpoint) will fail with a 403 Forbidden.

Read [OCS Authentication documentation](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/master/docs/AUTHENTICATION_README.md) to learn how to authenticate against OCS with the various clients and receive an access token in response.

## Error handling

All responses will have an error message in the body. The exceptions are 200 responses and the 401 Unauthorized response. The error message will appear as follows:

```json
{
    "OperationId": "1b2af18e-8b27-4f86-93e0-6caa3e59b90c", 
    "Error": "Error message.", 
    "Reason": "Reason that caused error.", 
    "Resolution": "Possible solution for the error." 
}
```

If and when contacting OSIsoft support about this error, please provide the OperationId.

## Streams

When a stream is shared, the members of the community it is shared to will be limited to read-only access.

> [!NOTE]
>
> For information on how to get data from a Stream, please see [API calls for reading data](xref:sdsReadingDataApi) in the **Sequential Data Store** section.
