## Verify the PI to OCS Agent is running and registered

After installation, check that the PI to OCS Agent Windows service is running on the machine where the agent is installed.

#### Procedure

1. On the host machine where you installed the agent, type *services.msc* in the text box next to the Windows menu button, then press ENTER.

2. In the `Services` window, scroll to and verify that that the PI to OCS Agentâ€™s status is running.

3. Navigate to the `PI to OCS Agents` window in OCS, then select the connection you just created. 

4. On the `Details` pane, Verify that **Registered** appears next to the **Agent Status** field.
