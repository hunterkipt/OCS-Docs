## Remove an agent from the OCS portal

You can remove an unneeded agent on the PI to OCS Agents page. Removing an agent removes all client and connection information from the OCS portal. Only authorized users can remove an agent from the OCS portal.  

â€‹	**Note:** To fully remove the agent, [uninstall the PI to OCS Agent software](xref:remove-agent) from the host computer.

1. Log on to the [OCS portal](https://cloud.osisoft.com).
2. Click the menu ![ ](../..\images\waffle-button.png) icon, then click **Data Collection > PI to OCS Agents**.

3. In the `PI to OCS Agents` window, select an agent in the list.

4. Click the **Remove Agent** button above the list of agents.

   **Result:** The **Remove Agent** dialog box opens.
   **Note:** If your OCS account does not have delete permissions, you will not be able to remove an agent. Contact your Tenant Administrator for assistance. 

5. Click **Remove**.

   **Result:** The agent is removed from the list and deleted from OCS.
